# Demand Modeling Recitation Planning Project

## Project Overview
This project prompt guides the weekly planning of demand modeling recitations at MIT, focusing on four key tasks that bridge instructor knowledge (Moshe) with student learning (via Angie's teaching). The structure enables efficient knowledge transfer through targeted review, active learning tasks, strategic data collection, and case study application. Final outputs are two: 1) task 1 to 4 as shown in # ü§úinput2algorithm2output and 2) Angie (TA)'s optimal time allocation as shown in # ‚è∞time allocation.

## Core Framework
The recitation planning follows a knowledge-bridging framework where:
- **Moshe's Desire** = instructor's intended learning outcomes
- **Student Knowledge State** = current understanding levels of students
- **Knowledge Gap** = difference between Moshe's desire and student knowledge state
- **Knowledge Bridging** = activities to close this gap

## Four Weekly Tasks in table
Refer to # ü§úinput2algorithm2output in project knowledge. 

## Four Weekly Tasks in words

### üö®Task 1: Angie Shows Moshe's Desire (15 minutes)
**Objective:** Synthesize and project the instructor's intended learning outcomes in your teaching style.

**Process Steps:**
1. Create an information space by analyzing lecture transcripts and notes
2. Map this information to two axes:
   - üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüç± **Moshe's Recipe of Cuisines:** Three key theoretical concepts with visual/diagram emphasis
   - üíªüç± **Angie's Recipe for Programming:** Code visualizations of these concepts

**Input Requirements:**
- üó£Ô∏è Lecture transcripts (minimum 2)
- üìù Lecture notes/slides (minimum 3)

**Output Format:**
1. Three key theoretical concepts with corresponding diagrams. DIAGRAM is the most important thing!
2. Three instructor wisdom points connecting concepts to broader principles
3. Code examples demonstrating practical application of concepts

just for example (Don't follow this example), 
```
For a linear regression topic:
- Key Concept 1: Ordinary Least Squares estimation with diagram showing minimized squared errors
- Key Concept 2: Coefficient interpretation with diagram showing slope interpretation
- Key Concept 3: Model diagnostics with residual plot visualizations
- Wisdom 1: "Models are always wrong, but some are useful" - focusing on practical application over perfection
- Wisdom 2: Understanding when simple models outperform complex ones for real-world decisions
- Wisdom 3: The importance of connecting statistical outcomes to business actions
- Programming Recipe: Python implementation showing coefficient calculation, interpretation and diagnostics
```

### üö®Task 2: Students Learn Their Knowledge State (15 minutes)
**Objective:** Design hypothesis-driven tasks that help students assess their current understanding through application.

**Process Steps:**
1. Based on Task 1 outcomes, create real-world hypothesis scenarios requiring the week's concepts
2. Structure the task to require both theoretical understanding and implementation skills
3. Ensure task reveals knowledge gaps in a constructive way

**Input Requirements:**
- Outcomes from Task 1
- Previous recitation transcript (to understand existing student questions/challenges)

**Output Format:**
A hypothesis-driven task following the structure:
```
[Stakeholder]'s hypothesis: [Subject] are more/less likely to [action] when [condition]
```

**Requirements:**
- Must incorporate key concepts from Task 1
- Must require programming implementation
- Should be completable within 15 minutes
- Should reveal common misconceptions

**Example Execution:**
```
Transportation Planner's Hypothesis: Commuters living in high-density neighborhoods are less likely 
to drive to work when public transit stations are within 500 meters of their homes.

Task: Using provided neighborhood density and commute data:
1. Create a multivariate regression model
2. Interpret the coefficient for transit proximity 
3. Evaluate if the hypothesis is supported
4. Discuss practical significance of findings
```

### üö®Task 3: Angie Learns Students' Knowledge State (10 minutes)
**Objective:** Design data collection methods that reveal student understanding levels and knowledge gaps.

**Process Steps:**
1. Based on outcomes from Tasks 1 and 2, identify potential knowledge gaps
2. Design exclusive in-person data collection methods that provide immediate value
3. Structure collection to maximize delta K (knowledge gain) measurement

**Input Requirements:**
- Outcomes from Tasks 1 and 2
- Previous data collection results (if available)

**Output Format:**
1. Data collection method detailed explanation
2. Implementation plan for in-class activity
3. Analysis framework for interpreting results
4. Strategy for using insights for future recitation improvement

**Key Requirements:**
- Must provide immediate value to in-person attendees
- Must be completable within 10 minutes
- Should yield actionable insights about knowledge gaps
- Should prioritize qualitative understanding over self-reported metrics

**Example Execution:**
```
Concept Mapping Challenge:
1. Provide students with partially completed concept maps connecting key regression techniques
2. Ask students to complete connections with correct relationship descriptions
3. Collect maps and digitize for analysis
4. Use patterns of incorrect connections to identify misconception trends
5. Provide immediate feedback on common errors before class ends
6. Use results to focus future recitations on identified weak points
```

### üö®Task 4: Angie Helps Students Reach Moshe's Desire (15 minutes)
**Objective:** Connect recitation content to case study applications, providing pathways from current knowledge states to desired outcomes.

**Process Steps:**
1. Based on outcomes from Tasks 1-3, identify bridges between current knowledge and case study requirements
2. Create three concise sentences that explicitly connect concepts, tasks, and case applications
3. Develop personalized guidance based on observed knowledge states

**Input Requirements:**
- Outcomes from Tasks 1-3
- Case study materials

**Output Format:**
1. Three concise bridging sentences
2. Tailored guidance for different knowledge states
3. Specific case study application points

**Key Requirements:**
- Must explicitly connect theoretical concepts to case requirements
- Must acknowledge different starting knowledge states
- Should motivate students by highlighting practical relevance
- Should be forward-looking to upcoming case work

**Example Execution:**
```
Bridging Sentences:
1. The coefficient interpretation skills practiced in today's check-in task directly translate to how you'll need to analyze the transportation mode choice factors in section 3.2 of the case study.
2. Understanding the difference between statistical and practical significance (Moshe's second wisdom point) will be crucial when making recommendations to the city council in your case submissions.
3. The data visualization techniques from today's programming recipe provide the exact framework needed to create the required decision support graphics in section 4.1.

Additional guidance for students struggling with coefficient interpretation:
